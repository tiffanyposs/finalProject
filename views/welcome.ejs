  <h3>You know when you go out to eat with your friends, then the bill comes and it takes
  an hour to figure out who owes what?</h3>
  <h3>Then you realize the bill is still $20 short even though everybody supposedly itemized 
  what they had and you end up paying extra even though you only had some fries?</h3>
  <h3>Splittr App is here to help all you calculation needs! Never pay extra again. Our app pulls
  menu items from the restaurant you just ate at, and you can split up the bill by the exact items
  you and your friends enjoyed! How great is that? Give it a try!</h3>
